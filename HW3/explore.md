Potential issue:
    - Sometimes the speaker is denoted as "Others" which is unclear
    - When there are 2 speakers, they are separated by an "and", but it is difficult to tell how more than 2 speakers will be represented
    - Sometimes speakers are denoted as "All" or "Main cast" except certain characters, which add conditions to parsing

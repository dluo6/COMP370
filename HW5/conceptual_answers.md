1.	A hospital wants to know how its medication stocks line up with patient demand in the hospital. Develop a use case that motivates this question by identifying a persona (presumably someone who works at the hospital) and a concrete activity that will make use of this information. Of course, we don’t have access to the hospital in question – so you’ll be developing your own use case. So there are many credible answers.

Someone who works at the hospital would need to know how the hospital's medication stocks line up with patient demand when perscribing a specific medicine to a patient. Depending on the availability, the staff should be informing the patient how long they are expected to wait to have access to the medication.


2.	Why does the real world impact the complexity of code we write in a data science project?

The real world often contains data that is very messy. Messy data requires messy solutions in order to fix, thus leading to our coded solutions to be complex.

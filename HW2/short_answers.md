1. Increased computing power: the facility holds space for much larger and powerful computers
    Better security: Unlike a laptop that can easily be stolen, cloud must be accessed through a key
    closer to data resources: Cloud can be located near data warehouses for faster processing
    Increased storage: Cloud partitions storage to devices, so the amount allocated can always be scaled up 

2. Question definition: Understanding the question that is to be answered through data
    Data collection: Collecting necessary data to answer the question
    Data anotation: Inserting new features in the data in order to facilitate the analysis of the data
    Data analysis: Processing the data in order to retrieve new statistics or metrics to answer the question
    Interpretation: Taking the results and determining how the data answers the original question
    Communication: Explaining the results and relevance of the analysis to stakeholders

3. In data analytics, existing tools are used in order to process anotated data and retrieve new insights. In data science, new tools are researched and developed to be used in analystics.

4. At every step, it is possible to have to go back to the previous step once we realize there is an error or that data needs to be re-processed for optimal results. In addition, at every step, it is possible that we realize that the question may need to be reformulated in order to answer a question that the stakeholders are truly looking to answer but may not have defined explicitly. The data science process must start from the beginning again due to newly updated information, which can lead to a loop.

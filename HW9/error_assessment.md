The discrepancy between categories is due to the taxonomy being vague, especially in many edge cases where more than one category can be applied. In that case, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish which category should take precedence. Additionally, some of the categories themselves are rather vague and can be interpreted to encompass other categories.

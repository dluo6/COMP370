1.	Why is the difference between found and designed data?
Found data is data that already exists online and can be repurposed to be used for our experiment. Designed data is data specifically collected in order to answer our question, so it takes more resources to gather, but it will be well tailored to answer our question.

2.	What are the two primary challenges that necessitate sampling when collecting data?
The first challenge is that the size of the data is too large in order to grab due to time or cost limitations. The second challenge is that that the definition of what we are querying is too unclear to collect everything.

3.	Why are website owners more likely to be upset about collecting data using scrapers than using APIs?
Scraping data is in a gray area of legality because there are no clear laws on web scraping. Website owners may often feel that their ownership of the website and its data is being violated with scraping. With APIs, website owners are giving consent for users to publicly collect and access data.

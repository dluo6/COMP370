1.	What is refactoring? Give three examples of refactoring techniques.
Refactoring is the process of reorganizing code without changing its functionality. Examples of refactoring include changing a variable name, altering the contract of a function, and changing the library being used.

2.	In a data science project, why does code naturally go through “phases” of messiness?
Data science projects involve a lot of dabbling, where it is important to do first by exploring possible methods of returning a desired result. Thus, dabbling requires going through different exploratory phases, and will inevitably be messy due to the unknown nature of exploring a solution, and the messiness of the problem itself.

3.	What are three techniques for creating more modular code?
Techniques for creating more modular code include breaking up code into reusable function, separating code into different classes/files, and categorizing code into relevant packages.
